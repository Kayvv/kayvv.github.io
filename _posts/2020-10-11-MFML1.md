2.1 We consider $(R\ \{−1\}, *)$, where
                                                              $a * b := ab + a + b, a, b ∈ R\ \{−1\} $(2.134)

a. Show that (R\{−1}, ?) is an Abelian group.

b. Solve
$3 * x * x = 15$
in the Abelian group (R\{−1}, ?), where ? is defined in (2.134).

2.2 Let n be in N\{0}. Let k, x be in Z. We define the congruence class k¯ of the
integer k as the set
k = {x ∈ Z | x − k = 0 (modn)}
= {x ∈ Z | ∃a ∈ Z: (x − k = n · a)} .
We now define Z/nZ (sometimes written Zn) as the set of all congruence
classes modulo n. Euclidean division implies that this set is a finite set containing n elements:
Zn = {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}
For all a, b ∈ Zn, we define
a ⊕ b := a + b
a. Show that (Zn, ⊕) is a group. Is it Abelian?
b. We now define another operation ⊗ for all a and b in Zn as
a ⊗ b = a × b , (2.135)
where a × b represents the usual multiplication in Z.
Let n = 5. Draw the times table of the elements of Z5\{0} under ⊗, i.e.,
calculate the products a ⊗ b for all a and b in Z5\{0}.
Hence, show that Z5\{0} is closed under ⊗ and possesses a neutral
element for ⊗. Display the inverse of all elements in Z5\{0} under ⊗.
Conclude that (Z5\{0}, ⊗) is an Abelian group.
c. Show that (Z8\{0}, ⊗) is not a group.
d. We recall that the B´ezout theorem states that two integers a and b are
relatively prime (i.e., gcd(a, b) = 1) if and only if there exist two integers
u and v such that au + bv = 1. Show that $(Zn\{0\}, ⊗) $is a group if and
only if $n ∈ N \ \{0\} $is prime.



2.3 Consider the set G of 3 × 3 matrices defined as follows:
$$
 \left\{G =
 \left[
 \begin{matrix}
   1 & x & z \\
   0 & 1 & y \\
   0 & 0 & 1
  \end{matrix}
  \right] 
  ∈ R^{3×3} | x, y, z ∈ R\right\} 
$$
We define · as the standard matrix multiplication.
Is (G, ·) a group? If yes, is it Abelian? Justify your answer.



2.4 Compute the following matrix products, if possible:
